Arithmetic Operators 
 x/y  - Float division quotient returned is always a Float 
x//y  - Floor Division quotient is dependent on the argument passed, if float is passed result will be a float value 
x%y   - Modulus returns the remainder 
x ** y - Power - Return first raised to power second 

Precendence of arithmetic Operators 
P - Paranthesis 
E - Exponentiation 
M -  Multiplication 
D -  Division 
Multiplication and Division has same precedence 
A - Addition 
S - Subtraction 
Addition and Subtraction has same precedence 

Precedence of Comparision Operators in Python 
comparision operators has lower precedence than arithmetic operators and all comparision operators have same precedence 

Precedence of Logical Operators in Python 
Logical Not > Logical AND > logical OR 

Bitwise Operators in Python 
Bitwise Operators act on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations. They are used to operate on Binary Numbers 
Bitwise OPerators Precedence 
Bitwise NOT 
Bitwise Shift 
Bitwise AND 
Bitwise XOR 
Bitwise OR 

Identity Operators 
In Python 'IS' and 'IS NOT' are the identity operators both are used to check if two values are located on the same part of memory. Two variables that are equal do not imply they are identical 

Membership Operators
In Python "in" and "not in" are used to test whether the value or variables are is in a sequence 
in -- True If value is in sequence 
not in - True if value is not in sequence 

Ternary Operator
Ternary operators are conditional expressions are operators that evaluate something based on a condition being true or false. 
Syntax - [on_true]if[expression]else[false]
